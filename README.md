# Instructions

This is just a guide with instructions on how to install and play around with GIT using VsCode.
Aditionally I left some instructions on how to run a simple python script that creates a few endpoints so you can try out Postman as well.
Feel free to message me with any questions.


### GIT Demo
#### Step 1 - installing GIT
Installing GIT is generally pretty straight forward, just use the official site (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and go to the section relevant to your Operative System (OS).
For windows you can use a regular installer that you can find in the downloads page, or, if you are feeling brave today, you can open powershell and run this command ```winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget```.


#### Step 2 - Installing VsCode
VsCode is an Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE) made by Microsoft that's super versatile and easy to use. Especially for PVs if they need to do simple things like opening a JSON file, scripts, etc. 
In this demo we are going to use it to clone this repository, make a new branch, make some small change and commit it. 
You can find it here https://code.visualstudio.com/download , just pick the right one for your OS. 

Installation should be straight forward, just open it when you are done.


#### Step 3 - clonning a repo
By default VsCode should already detect that you have GIT installed.
